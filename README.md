Active Vision Assistant

Active Vision Assistant is an experimental eye-tracking program that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify objects on a screen based on where the user is looking. The goal is to create a functional assistant capable of recognizing and highlighting on-screen content in real time, with the help of OpenCV and third-party APIs for object identification.

ðŸš€ Project Goals

    Develop an AI-driven eye-tracking system using OpenCV.

    Map the user's eye gaze to the corresponding screen coordinates.

    Identify and highlight on-screen objects in the user's gaze zone.

    Connect to a third-party API to retrieve and display object information.

ðŸ“Œ Development Phases
Part One â€“ Core Functionality

    User Input to AI System
    Initialize system with webcam input and calibrate eye-tracking mechanism.

    Eye Tracking & Gaze Mapping
    Use OpenCV to detect eye position and correlate gaze to screen coordinates.

    Object Detection in Gaze Area
    Identify objects within the area the user is looking at and visually highlight them.

    API Integration for Object Identification
    Send gaze-zone image or coordinates to an external API for real-time object labeling.
